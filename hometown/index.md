# Green's End (home town)
## Situation
- Last town before the Desert
- in the foothills of the mountains
- in the valley of the Pissouri River
- at a bridge and fork in the road: 
    - north: the Town of Cliffbridge, which has a train station
    - West: the mining outpost of [Wind's Gulch](town.winds_gulch.md), high between the mountains
    - From there the road leads to Liz Mah Naar, a village of native drakona and settler elves
    - North-East (across the river), the lumbering outpost of [TODO] encroaches on Native homelands (Native Village)
    - to the south, this town is one of the last stops on the [Ticken Trail](ticken_trail.md), before this hazardous road crosses the Great Southern Desert
- Recently, a large deposit of Dragon Guano was discovered under the town
