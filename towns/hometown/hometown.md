# üè†Green's End (home town)
## Situation
- Last town before the Desert
- in the foothills of the mountains
- in the valley of the Pissouri River
- at a bridge and fork in the road:
  - north: the Town of Cliffbridge, which has a train station
  - West: the mining outpost of [Wind's Gulch](/towns/winds-gulch/mine-outpost.md), high between the mountains
  - From there the road leads to Liz Mah Naar, a village of native drakona and settler elves
  - North-East (across the river), the lumbering outpost of [TODO](/towns/lumber-post/lumber-post.md) encroaches on Native homelands (Native Village)
  - to the south, this town is one of the last stops on the [Ticken Trail](/regions/borderlands/ticken-trail.md), before this hazardous road crosses the Great Southern Desert
- Recently, a large deposit of Dragon Guano was discovered under the town
